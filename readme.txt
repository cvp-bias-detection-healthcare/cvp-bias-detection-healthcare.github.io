Once Python is available on your PC and an environment is activated:

1.	Run “Git clone https://github.com/cvp-bias-detection-healthcare/cvp-bias-detection-healthcare.github.io”
2.	Run “pip install requirements.txt”

To use the measure_disparity.py file:
1.	Open “measure_disparity.py”, located in the scripts folder, in a text editor.
2.	The first 15 lines of code are used for storing metadata about your dataset of interest. Please modify them as needed to locate the data, tag the protected features, and label which columns have the probabilities, the true labels and sample weights. Save your changes.
3.	Run “python measure_disparity.py”. An HTML report (“measure_rerport.html”) will be automatically generated in the “reports” folder
4.	Double click it or transfer to a computer with an internet connected web browser to review it.

To use the mitigate_disparity.py file:
1.	As required by the challenge, the mitigate script returns a Python object/class with fit(), transform(), and predict() methods in addition to a measure() method for report generation. Read the README inline comments for the class creation instance and class methods to understand the arguments and parameters they need as input
2.	The “mitigate_disparity.py” file needs to be imported as a module in another notebook or a .py script.
3.	For ease of use, we have included a “run_mitigate.ipynb” sample notebook which is setup to use the object and its methods to perform a full mitigation
4.	You may run this notebook as is with our sample data file (“diabetes_data”) or copy its contents for use with your own dataset
5.	For the latter, you will need to define your train and test pandas dataframes 
6.	We recommend predefining all of the critical fields (like in the measure script) that need be passed into the class and methods
7.	For this script, the LightGBM model parameters dictionary is another critical field, and you can either keep it as is or modify as you see fit for your dataset
8.	Once all required parameter inputs are defined, initialize the Mitigator object and call its methods in this order: transform(), fit(), predict(), measure(). These together will generate the “imbalance_report.html” and the “mitigate_report.html” (same format analysis as “measure_report.html”) in the reports folder. It also outputs the transformed train dataset, the predicted test dataset, and the threshold tuned predicted test dataset to help build an audit trail.
